# upload-test-server

Small node server with a CLI to test file uploads.
Powered by [hapi](https://hapijs.com).

## Why?

I search for a simple and easy to setup server that does just one thing.  
Letting me test file uploads with front end gui stuff I work on.

## Install

`npm install -g upload-test-server`

## Run it

`upload-test-server start`

Starts the server on localhost:8989 and accepts file uploads at http://localhost:8989/upload.  
By default all uploaded files are saved to the current working directory.  
If the upload folder doesn't exist, it's created as soon as a file is uploaded.

[See options for more](#server-options)

The server accepts any origin, so you shouldn't have any trouble with cors.  
**This also means don't use this stuff in production!**
